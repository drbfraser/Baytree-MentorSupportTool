    <h1>The Baytree Centre</h1>
    <h3>is a social inclusion charity for women and girls, based in the heart of Brixton, south London. An integral part of the community since 1991, we provide holistic support through personal development activities and workshops, mentoring, coaching, as well as English classes and integration support for newly arrived migrants and refugees.
Our approach is informed by our Character Development Programme, which aims to equip the women and girls who come to the centre with all the skills they need to succeed and flourish in life.</h3>
