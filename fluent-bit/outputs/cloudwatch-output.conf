# WARNING!!!
# Do not refactor the cloudwatch outputs below to be just a single output.
# This will result in a fluent bit error where it is unable to 
# handle the workload generated. I beleive using a single output means a single 
# thread will perform the output operation for all matches. Fluent bit 
# is unable to handle the workload by a single thread in our case at the moment.
